# Implementation:

### Q) What libraries did you add to the frontend? What are they used for?
I have used the following two libraries
1. `Moment JS`: It is used to format arrival, departure and total-duration (time) of the flight
2. `Font-awesome`: As we all know, It's a icon library.
### Q) What's the command to start the application locally?

(Default) `npm start`: It will start the react-application on 3000 port and also start (proxy) server on 8080 port

# General:

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
From the architecture perspective, I'll do the following
1. Use `Redux`: As the application grows, we would require redux to elegantly manage the state of the application.
2. Create abstract stylesheet: to manage global attributes like color, typography & mixins.
### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
Clean and quality code. I try to keep my code simple, readable and reusable. I don't keep everything in one component and always try to break them down into smaller maintenance components. Also, I am open to feedback and will welcome if there is any.

### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
I spent a fair amount of time on it. To be fair, I started today and completed it in about 4-5 hours.

### Q) How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing?If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
As I am familiar with both Node and React JS, so I had no difficulty completing it.
